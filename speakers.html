					<h1>Myles Drake: The Simplicity of Empathy</h1>
					<img class="img-2" src="images/two.png"/>
                    <p>Myles Drake was born and raised in Grimsby, Ontario. Highly influenced by his uncles at a young age who were mechanics and auto workers, Myles began to tinker with dirt bikes. By age 15 he was full blown into competitive motocross racing, a sport which tends to wreak havocon the body. After finding a local yoga class, he soon recovered his degenerating spinal discs and became qualified to instruct by travelling to India
                    and obtaining certification. Motocross Racing inspired him to obtain a Bachelor's Degree in Automotive Engineering Technology from McMaster University, which he received in 2014. From there he moved to the Green Mountain State in Vermont to work for a Factory Sponsored Subaru Rally Car Race Team. It was a childhood dream come true. After 2 years living in Vermont he received an opportunity to travel across Canada sharing a message about empathy to youth and has since spoken to over 20,000 students in 55 high schools through the non-profit called Live Different.</p>
                    <br/><p>
                    Subject: The focus of the talk will be empathy; how it’s a driving force in furthering relationships, a skill, and how it can be improved over time. Personal anecdotes
                    will be included to enhance the idea worth spreading</p>

					<h1>LY Marlow</h1>
					<img class="img-2" src="images/speakers/LYMarlow.jpg" alt="image two" />
					<p>Having grown up in a drug- and crime-infested project in Philadelphia, a product of teen pregnancy, who escaped an unspeakable abusive relationship and then put herself through sixteen years of night school (sometimes with baby in tow) to earn multiple degrees including an MBA, L.Y. Marlow’s story would be notable enough given her tenacity to shatter the status quo. But it would be her courageous decision to step down from a promising 20+ year corporate career to found Saving Promise—a national domestic violence prevention nonprofit inspired by five generations of mothers and daughters in her family that survived more than sixty years of domestic violence, including her granddaughter, a little girl named Promise. Key to the Saving Promise’s vision is a collaboration with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health to launch one of the first of its kind research and development Learning Labs to put forth innovative, evidence-based public education and preventions strategies to prevent intimate partner violence. This heartfelt and captivating story of tragedy to triumph moved L.Y. to share her journey in her memoir: ‘Don’t Look at the Monster: One Woman’s Journey to Embrace a Purposeful Life—the Gifts, the Lessons & the Blessings’. L.Y. is a dedicated and sought-after media talent, lecturer and spokeswoman for domestic violence prevention and women empowerment. Her authentic voice as a survivor, mother and friend—an ordinary woman with an extraordinary story—is a testament to the transformative power to embrace one’s passion, purpose and power.<br /><br />L.Y. Marlow is the Founder & CEO, Saving Promise; Founder of MonsteRise (a new women empowerment brand); and the award-winning author of Color Me Butterfly, A Life Apart and Don’t Look at the Monster.

                    <br/>
                    <p>Subject: Hayley’s focus will be discussing the fact that although body image issues are far less taboo than they were previously, women are still marginalized, often to the point where their grievances are avoided all together. She will highlight fighting against self-hatred, as well as uplifting the self. Her talk will further connect with the rest of the audience by discussing affects in STEM fields!</p>
